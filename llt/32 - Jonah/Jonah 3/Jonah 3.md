1And the word of Yahweh was to Yonah a second time, saying: 2“Arise, go to Nineveh the great city, and call out to it the calling-out which I am speaking to you.
3And Yonah arose and he went to Nineveh, according to the word of Yahweh. Now, Nineveh was a great city to Elohim, a walking of three days. 4And Yonah began to go into the city a walking of one day, and he called out, and he said, “Forty days, and Nineveh is overturned.”
5And the men of Nineveh believed in Elohim, and they called out a fast, and they were clothed with sackcloth, from the great of them and to the small of them.
6And the word reached to the king of Nineveh and he arose from his throne and he removed his robe from upon him and he covered with sackcloth and he sat in the dust. 7And he cried out and he said: “In Nineveh, from order of the king and his great ones, saying: The human and the beast, the cattle and the flock, don’t let them taste anything; don’t let them graze; and don’t let them drink water, 8and let them cover themselves with sackcloth, the human and the beast, and let them call out to Elohim with force, and let each man turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. 9Who knows? The-Elohim may turn and repent and turn from the heat of his anger, so that we will not perish.
10And the-Elohim saw their doings, that they turned from their evil way, and the-Elohim repented concerning the evil which he spoke to do to them, and he did not do it.
