1And it was evil to Yonah, a great evil, and there was heat-anger to him.
2And he prayed to Yahweh and he said,
“Please, Yahweh! Was not this my word while I was upon my land? Therefore I acted before to flee to Tarshish, because I knew that you are a Elohim, gracious and compassionate, long-of- anger, and great of covenant love, and who repents concerning evil.
