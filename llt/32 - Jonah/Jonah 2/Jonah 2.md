1and Yonah prayed to Yahweh his Elohim from the inner-parts of the fish, 2and he said:
I called out from my distress to Yahweh
and he answered me;
from the belly of the grave/Sheol I shouted for help
and you heard my voice;
3and you cast me to the deep, to the heart of the seas
and a river surrounded me
all your waves and breakers passed over me
4and I said: I am banished from before your eyes
however, I will continue to gaze to your holy temple
5the waters encircled me up to the neck
the deep surrounded me
kelp wrapped to my head
6to the bases of the mountains I went down
the underworld, its bars around me, forever
but you raised up my life from the pit, Yahweh my Elohim
7when my being was fainting within me,
I remembered Yahweh
and my prayer came to you
to your holy temple
8those who keep idols of worthlessness
forsake the covenant love shown them
9but I, with a voice of thanksgiving, I will sacrifice to you
what I have vowed I will pay in full
Rescue belongs to Yahweh!
10And Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited Yonah onto the dry land.
